**City of Helsinki & Forum Virium Helsinki:**  
The initiative is led by the [City of Helsinki](https://www.hel.fi/en), chiefly through [Forum Virium Helsinki](https://forumvirium.fi/en/) (the city's innovation company) which coordinated Smart Kalasatama. The city set the vision, provided land and funding, and convened partners. Multiple city departments (urban planning, transportation, housing, IT, etc.) were involved in implementation, aligning the project with municipal strategies. Forum Virium acted as the program manager and facilitator between public and private actors.

**Developers & Utilities:**  
The area's redevelopment involved private developers like [SRV](https://www.srv.fi/en/srv-as-a-company/investor/), which built major projects and implemented many smart infrastructure elements. City-owned utilities such as [Helen](https://www.helen.fi/en) (Helsinki Energy) were key for energy innovations, using their grids as a testbed for smart energy systems. The presence of these stakeholders ensured that smart solutions were installed in buildings and infrastructure as they were constructed.

**Startups & Technology Providers:**  
 A range of companies participated in Kalasatama's pilots and services. Dozens of local startups and small enterprises received micro-grants to test solutions like a smart parking app or a meal-sharing service. Larger firms also played a role. For instance, elevator company KONE and others contributed expertise in 'people flow' tech and platforms. The district became a hub where 'small, agile innovators and large established companies coexist and collaborate' on urban tech.

**Residents and Community Groups:**  
Kalasatama's residents are both end-users and co-creators. Adopters formed resident networks that helped shape the 'One More Hour' vision and volunteered in pilots. Residents also benefit via a local association that manages shared amenities (like urban gardens or a community living room), ensuring that even vulnerable or less tech-savvy groups can partake in the district's offerings. Thus community engagement ensured inclusive service design and encouraged everyday innovation.

**Academia & Research Partners:**  
Universities like Aalto and research institutions helped design digital tools and evaluate outcomes, ensuring evidence-based planning and knowledge transfer.

These driverless minibuses, part of the EU SOHJOA project, operated with sensors, LIDAR, and GPS, sending real-time data to cloud systems. The pilot supported Helsinki's Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) vision, where residents can access various transport modes via a single app. The district also features shared e-cars, bike services, and smart traffic systems. These interventions reduce private car use and emissions, improving urban mobility while enhancing residents' daily efficiency.


## Financing
<!--  How are the technology interventions identified to be financed? How does this fit into financing of the larger project? Identify at least one financing mechanism that is being used. -->

**Public Funding and Innovation Grants:**
The City of Helsinki provided funding through Forum Virium, its innovation company. A key feature was the Agile Piloting Programme, which offered micro-grants (€1k-8k) to startups and community groups to prototype smart services. This minimized financial risk while enabling experimentation. Instead of committing to large vendor contracts, the city used these grants to test ideas quickly and scale only what worked.

**City Investment and Private Development:**
As the landowner, Helsinki invested in core infrastructure like fiber networks, streets, energy systems and used zoning and development agreements to require private developers to include smart features in new buildings. Developers like SRV funded the construction of residential towers and integrated systems like smart meters and automated waste collection, aligned with the city's digital master plan. The public-private partnership model allowed the city to embed smart infrastructure from the start without bearing all the cost.

**External Project Funding:**
Smart Kalasatama got additional money and support from the European Union. For example, it was part of EU-funded projects like mySMARTLife and BioTope, which helped pay for pilots in smart energy, mobility, and data-sharing platforms. These projects also brought in researchers and tech partners to develop and test solutions. Universities helped the city apply for grants and measure the impact of the projects. Some of the small pilots (like shared space apps or smart services) later became real businesses, supported by subscriptions or outside investors. City-owned companies like Helen (energy) also spent money on smart systems like solar power and electric vehicle charging. Altogether, this outside funding helped the city try out big ideas without needing to pay for everything from its own budget.
